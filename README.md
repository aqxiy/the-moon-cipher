### A recompiled scoliosis pt methodology.

## Established:
1. Pilates
2. Foundation Training with/without on minor incline & @ angles on incline.
3. Pacing and shuffling with varied body tilts and foot outward anglings.
4. Varied angle and grip technique + position with long dowel rod.
5. Core Strengthening and Stabilization exercises. Often, it's completely fine to take a generic core strengthening and/or stabilization exercise from Google and modify by tensing/engaging core throughout, particularly the transversus abdominus, which when correctly modified can serve to provide steady relief. That's aligned with what my PT for Schroth suggested. You can engage your core reliably in a few ways.
   
-- Otherwise & further, the incorporation of 2/3 - 3/4 ratio range to rep counts (mostly 5/7, 7/10) with rotate 180 & lightly say "ok" between sets where ratio range is applied

## Extended Tutorial
You can engage your core reliably in a few ways:

*Instructions:*

| By making a "sssshhhh" sound as you try to coordinate your abs toward stability

|| By 

  1. a. Take a deep breath in from your diaphragm. As you exhale, draw your belly button toward your spine.
  2. b. For 360-degree core activation, contract the muscles in the front and side of your core, as well as those in your lower back.
  3. c. Hold the contraction for a second before releasing but try to concentration in a way that mantains a level of tension.



||| My technique: With arms straight at your side, move them outwards and upwards in a loop, then inhale + contract/activate sharply but minorly + apply steps 2-3 from above.

4. Simple exercise band exercises. be careful, follow concrete instructionals. Try a time and set/rep ratio of between 2/3 - 3/4. Direction/side you begin the exercise on counts. here and elsewhere.

5. Walking and shuffling either direction leaning slightly forwards/backwards with core atvarious levels of tension and with feet at either 8-15 deg outward or 35 degree outward. Plus, try intermediate angles of bodily tilt direction (or, diagonals).

6. A good 5ft Natural Bamboo Yoga Stick and varied movements. Karma Heart brand works well.
